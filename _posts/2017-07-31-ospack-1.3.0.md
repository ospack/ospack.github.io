Today I'd like to announce Ospack 1.3.0. The most significant change since 1.2.0 is that `ospack install python` no longer installs a `python` binary without manual `PATH` additions and instead installs a `python2` binary. This avoids overriding the system `python` binary by default when installing Python as a dependency. It also paves the way to eventually have `python` be Python 3.x.

Major changes and deprecations since 1.2.0:

- [`ospack install` (and `upgrade`/`reinstall`) use the macOS sandbox for all builds by default](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2898)
- [`revision` is deprecated in favour of `rebuild` in `bottle do` blocks](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2899)
- [`fails_with :llvm` is deprecated as it's always a no-op](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2899)
- [versioned aliases' `opt` links for taps are created based on their name and not in subdirectories](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2923)
- [`ospack link` and `ospack unlink` state is preserved after `ospack install` and `ospack upgrade` (including for keg-only formulae)](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2961)
- [`ospack test` requires non-keg-only formulae to be linked](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2816)
- [events we didn't use are no longer reported to analytics](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2752)
- [`BuildErrors` reported to analytics now include the requested formula installation options](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2758)

While all the functionality for these deprecations will be supported for the foreseeable future in [Ospack/ospack](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack) for 3rd-party usage, [Ospack/ospack-core](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack-core) has removed the use of these APIs from formulae to improve the user experience.

Other changes since 1.2.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [`default_formula` are always used when pouring bottles again](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2969)
- [`ospack --prefix` is faster](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2940)
- [`with_env` can be used to simplify temporarily setting environment variables](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2883)

- [`ospack update` arguments tell you more explicitly which `ospack upgrade` command to run](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2858)
- [`ospack bump-formula-pr` now works with a shallow Git clone of a tap](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2829)
- [versions are detected](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2827) [more reliably from URLs](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2931)
- [you can `ospack install` formulae whose dependency trees require more than one version of the same `:build`-time dependency](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2954)
- [`:build`-time requirements are no longer fatal when installing from bottles](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2815)
- [`ospack edit` will use `atom` if available](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2749)
- [Basic](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2732) [macOS](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2738) [10.13](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2759) [High](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2973) [Sierra](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2806) [support](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2872)
- [`ospack search` includes Ospack Cask results even when it is tapped](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2721)

- [`ospack postinstall` allows reinstalling `etc` and `var`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2579)
- [Many](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2628) [`ospack audit`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2631) [checks](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2662) [have](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2664) [been](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2755) [ported](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2790) [to](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2843) [`rubocop`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2879) [providing](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2901) [in-editor](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2905) [feedback](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2911) [on Ospack style](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2932)
