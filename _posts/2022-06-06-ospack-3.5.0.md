Today I'd like to announce Ospack 3.5.0. The most significant changes since 3.4.0 are improved `ospack update` behaviour and Ospack (on macOS) requiring at least OS X El Capitan (10.11).

Major changes and deprecations since 3.4.0:

- [`ospack update` now defaults to `OSPACK_UPDATE_REPORT_ONLY_INSTALLED` behaviour, showing only information on installed formulae, so `OSPACK_UPDATE_REPORT_ALL_FORMULAE` was added instead](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13299). This improves performance and usability of `ospack update`.
- [`ospack update` lists "Outdated" rather than "Updated" formulae by default](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13375). It was already calculating which formulae were outdated and this information is more useful than showing which formulae were changed and is significantly faster than doing version comparisons.
- [Ospack (on macOS) now requires at least OS X El Capitan (10.11) to run rather than OS X Yosemite (10.10)](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13378). This is because we have released [Portable Ruby 2.6.8_1](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13376) using our new pipeline and have been unable to successfully virtualise Yosemite.
- [Various code disables and deletions for 3.5.0](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13347).

Other changes since 3.4.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [`ospack tests --changed` runs tests only on files that have been changed from `master`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13158) (including [test files](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13237)).
- [`ospack tap --no-force-auto-update` removes the `--force-auto-update` flag for taps](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13253).
- [`ospack` no longer filters the `TERMINFO_DIRS` environment variable](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13273).
- [`ospack update --quiet` makes `ospack update` produce less output](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13245).
- [`ospack uninstall`, `ospack reinstall`, etc. are no longer blocked by unreadable casks](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13289).
- [`ospack upgrade` only upgrades `version :latest` casks when `--greedy` or `--greedy-latest` are passed and the cask has been updated](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13275).
- [`ospack cleanup` shows the total disk space freed](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12970).
- [`OSPACK_DOCKER_REGISTRY_TOKEN` and `OSPACK_DOCKER_REGISTRY_BASIC_AUTH_TOKEN` can be used for GitHub Packages authentication without `OSPACK_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13313).
- [`OSPACK_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN`'s description in `man ospack` has been clarified](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13227).

Finally:

- [Ospack left the SFC](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12532) and has [moved to OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/ospack). This allows more permissive spending of our funds in exchange for our incomings/outgoing being public.
- [Ospack's governance documentation was updated, following our April 2022 AGM's vote on this. This notes Ospack's move to OpenCollective, PLC quorum and member changes and clarifies responsibilities for PL, PLC and TLC](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13073).
- [Ospack accepts donations through GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Ospack) and [still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ospack). If you can afford it, please consider donating. If you'd rather not use GitHub Sponsors or Patreon (our preferred donation methods), [check out the other ways to donate in our README](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/#donations).

Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far.
