Ospack is pleased to congratulate [Workospack on their 1.0 launch today](https://workospack.com/blog/workospack-1-0). [Workospack is a company](https://workospack.com) founded by several Ospack members and the Project Leader, @MikeMcQuaid, to use Ospack as the foundation of a secure software delivery platform. Workospack’s product is out of beta and ready to solve your workplace’s problems with securing Ospack at scale, so go check it out\!

We understand that the community will, rightly, have questions. You’ll find some answers below. This relationship is mutually beneficial: Workospack employees work on Ospack during working hours, and Workospack sponsors Ospack on GitHub Sponsors. Workospack’s founders care deeply about the success and independence of Ospack.

Ospack itself is and will always remain open source and free (as in speech and beer 🍺).

## Ospack and Workospack FAQs

### How are Ospack and Workospack related?

Ospack is an open source project and [part of the non-profit Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/ospack) run by unpaid volunteers (bar a small $300/month stipend for opted-in active maintainers).

Workospack is a product (with paid tiers) and company run by founders and employees.

At the time of writing, some of Ospack and Workospack’s leadership overlap (@MikeMcQuaid, @mozzadrella) and Workospack employs some Ospack maintainers (@Bo98, @carlocab).

### Is Workospack in control of Ospack?

No. Ospack has an [independent governance structure](https://docs.ospack.github.io/Ospack-Governance) that can only be changed through a supermajority of votes cast. Ospack’s Project Leadership Committee (PLC) restricts any employer (including Workospack) from holding more than 2 seats on the PLC.

Additionally, on the code side, Ospack is BSD-2 licensed with no CLA and \>10,000 contributors.

In practice, this means that neither Ospack or Workospack could relicense Ospack without \>10,000 people agreeing to it (or their code being rewritten) which is essentially impossible.

### Is Workospack going to make us pay for Ospack?

No. Only Ospack could decide to do this and we have no plans to do so. Workospack includes Ospack and charges money for certain Workospack plans - as permitted by Ospack’s license - but cannot ever make Ospack not open source.

### Did Ospack know this was coming?

Yes. Workospack kept Ospack’s leadership, maintainers and membership in the loop from early in the company’s conception. We’re very grateful for this transparency.
