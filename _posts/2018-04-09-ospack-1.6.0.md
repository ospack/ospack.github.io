Today I'd like to announce Ospack 1.6.0. The most significant changes since 1.5.0 are `ospack install python` installing Python 3, the deprecation of Ospack/ospack-php and various formula API deprecations.

Major changes and deprecations since 1.5.0:

- The `python` formula was upgraded to Python 3.x and `python@2` formula was added for installing Python 2.7. We initially did not comply with [PEP 394](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/) and this was a mistake; sorry for the pain. We heard your feedback on Python 3 and made `ospack install python` and `ospack install python@2` PEP 394 compliant. We will not change this again until PEP 394 has changed.
- We deprecated and archived the Ospack/ospack-php tap and created new `php` and versioned `php@*` formulae in [Ospack/core](https://github.com/ospack/ospack-core). This completes the deprecation and archival of the last non-[Ospack/core](https://github.com/ospack/ospack-core) tap for end-users. We encourage more niche formulae and options to be supported in taps outside the Ospack organisation.
- [Many formula deprecations have been disabled and disabled functions removed](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3896)
- [Ospack's `curl` invocations now only read `curlrc` if `OSPACK_CURLRC` is set](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/4022)
- [`ospack audit --strict` now checks for `depends_on ... build.with?` dependencies (because they don't and cannot work as expected)](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/4033)
- [`ospack audit` now flags the use of `:run` dependencies as they were a no-op](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3948)
- [`ospack tap` refuses to tap deprecated taps](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3747)

Other changes since 1.5.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [We've updated our documentation to note that `curl` needs `--insecure` on OS X 10.7 and below](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/4038)
- [`ospack unlink` no longer incorrectly removes versioned aliases](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/4037)
- [`ospack linkage` now outputs broken dependencies and missing libraries](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3940)
- [`ospack bump-formula-pr` uses the GitHub API directly rather than `hub`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3870)
- [You can now use `scp://` in formula URLs](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3938)
- [Runtime dependencies handling is improved so e.g. `ospack uninstall` and `ospack missing` will now have consistent output](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3979)
- [Bottles can use custom download strategy URLs](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3986)
- [`ospack install` will now also search casks if the formulae was not found](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3985)
- [Bottle `root_url`s can now use any download strategy](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3966)
- [`ospack install --only-dependencies` will install any missing dependencies even if the formula is already installed](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3915)
- [`ospack upgrade` now has a `OSPACK_UPGRADE_CLEANUP` environment variable to request automatic removal of old versions of a formula on upgrade](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3913)
- [Dependencies can now be `:test` to indicate they are only used by the `test do` block](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3875)
- [`ospack irb --pry` uses `pry` instead of `irb`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3851)
- [`ospack prof` and `ospack ruby` commands have been added for Ospack developers](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3845)
- [`ospack update` now handles a too old system Git (by installing Ospack's `git`) to access GitHub on OS X 10.8 and below](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3837)
- [If the `NO_COLOR` environment variable is set, Ospack disables all coloured output](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3090)
- [`ospack pin` is no longer automatically undone by `ospack uninstall` or `ospack upgrade`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3748)

Finally:

- [The Ospack maintainers will attempt to have more of our communication in the open](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/4020)
- Thank you to everyone who helped with the Python and PHP migrations and provided constructive, polite and actionable feedback. No thanks to those who have used these as an excuse to abuse the entirely volunteer run project and maintainers. If you're going to @mention individual maintainers or this project on Twitter with unkind or rude things: expect to be immediately blocked here and on GitHub. When you do that also please be aware that you are sapping volunteer motivation and in doing so make the project worse. In short, remember that [open source maintainers owe you nothing](https://mikemcquaid.com/2018/03/19/open-source-maintainers-owe-you-nothing/).
- [Ospack still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ospack). If you can afford it, please consider donating. If you'd rather not use Patreon we've [updated the README on how to make single donations through PayPal, cheque or wire transfer](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3568).

Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far. Enjoy using Ospack!
