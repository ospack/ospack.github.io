Today I'd like to announce Ospack 2.5.0. The most significant changes since 2.4.0 are better `ospack cask` integration, license support and API deprecations.

Major changes and deprecations since 2.4.0:

- Many `ospack cask` [commands](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8387) [have](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8302) [been](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8387) replaced with `ospack` commands and are deprecated. This continues our goal of better integration between `ospack` and `ospack cask` commands.
- [Most Ospack/ospack-core formulae have their licenses stored and audited](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/7762).
- [`ospack typecheck` provides the beginnings of Ospack's use of Sorbet for type-checking](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8289).
- [Ospack is currently experimenting with GitHub Discussions as a possible replacement for Discourse](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8570).
- [`ospack livecheck` has moved from its own tap to a Ospack command and part of Ospack/ospack-core formulae](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8180).
- [`ospack bump` is a new command using `ospack livecheck` and Repology to output outdated formulae in Ospack/ospack-core](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/7834).
- [Ospack on Linux is moving towards a pure-Ruby ELF reading and writing implementation](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/7213).
- [Various other Ospack (mostly internal) APIs have been deprecated](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8513)

Other changes since 2.4.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [`ospack sh` has a non-interactive mode](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8482).
- [Disabled and deprecated formulae require a reason (to better explain to users)](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8512).
- [`ospack bump-revision` accepts multiple formulae](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8358).
- [`ospack cask --help` output is supported for all `ospack cask` commands](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8239).
- [`ospack audit` now has a `--tap` argument](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8231).
- [`ospack tap-new` makes use of Ospack's custom GitHub Actions (which are also used by Ospack CI)](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8210).
- [`ospack audit` is passing and mandatory for all changes on Ospack/ospack-core](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8153).
- [`ospack update-python-resources` is a new command that can be used to upgrade dependencies in Python formulae](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8059).
- [`ospack tests` retries failed tests by default](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8135).
- [`ospack bundle` runs `ospack update` before if needed](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8118).
- [Many `ospack audit` checks were migrated to](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/7909) [RuboCop](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/7837) checks for better performance and editor integration.
- [Ospack is working on support for macOS Big Sur (11.0)](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/7791).

Finally:

- [Ospack accepts donations through GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Ospack) and [still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ospack). If you can afford it, please consider donating. If you'd rather not use GitHub Sponsors or Patreon (our preferred donation methods), [check out the other ways to donate in our README](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/#donations).
