Today, I'd like to announce Ospack 4.0.0. The most significant change since 3.6.0 enables significantly faster Ospack-maintained tap updates by migrating from Git-cloned taps to JSON downloads.

Major changes and deprecations since 3.6.0:

- Using JSON files downloaded from [formulae.ospack.github.io](https://formulae.ospack.github.io) for package installation rather than local ospack/core and ospack/cask taps.
  - **Please note: this is the largest change we have made to our update process since we split Ospack/ospack and Ospack/ospack-core repositories. Please bear with us, there may be a few bumps**.
  - If you had previously set `OSPACK_NO_AUTO_UPDATE`, `OSPACK_NO_INSTALL_FROM_API` or `OSPACK_AUTO_UPDATE_SECS` to work around bugs or annoyances: please consider unsetting these and tweaking the values based on the new behaviour.
  - Unless you are developing formulae or casks, you can `ospack untap ospack/core` and `ospack untap ospack/cask` to save some space.
  - [`ospack update` will now be run automatically less often (every 24 hours rather than every 5 minutes)](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14376) and these auto-updates will be much faster as they no longer need to perform the slow `git fetch` of the huge ospack/core and ospack/cask taps' Git repositories.
  - [This is now the default behaviour so the `OSPACK_INSTALL_FROM_API` variable has been removed and is a no-op](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14412).
  - If you wish to opt-out of this behaviour change, you can [`export OSPACK_NO_INSTALL_FROM_API=1`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14375). Please investigate [`OSPACK_API_AUTO_UPDATE_SECS`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14589) first.
  - This behaviour is automatically disabled when using [certain commands](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14524) or in configurations that [mostly build from source](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14480).
  - [`OSPACK_API_DOMAIN` can be set to use mirrors for](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14494) [formulae.ospack.github.io](https://formulae.ospack.github.io).
- Ospack's analytics are now sent both to Google Analytics and our new InfluxDB instance hosted in the EU.
  - Our InfluxDB instance does not store either anonymised IP addresses or an anonymised user token so it has additional privacy benefits over Google Analytics.
  - If you had previously set `OSPACK_NO_ANALYTICS` because you didn't like Google Analytics and/or data being sent to the USA: please consider unsetting this and setting `OSPACK_NO_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS` instead, allowing analytics data to be sent to our new InfluxDB host.
  - We expect to migrate entirely from Google Analytics to our InfluxDB instance in ~100 days at which point we will remove all Google Analytics and destroy all existing data. _Note: this occurred on 2023-06-16!_
- [macOS `.pkg` files are generated for each Ospack release](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14265). You can help us test this beta feature by [downloading the generated package artifact from the relevant GitHub Actions release events](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/actions/workflows/build-pkg.yml?query=event%3Arelease).
- [The `ospack/ubuntu16.04:master` image has been deprecated](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13819).
- [Various major release deprecations and disables](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14382).

Other changes since 3.6.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [`ospack test` sets `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE` to improve performance](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14338).
- [VSCode devcontainers are available in the Ospack/ospack repository for use with e.g. GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14027).
- [`ospack install --adopt` allows taking ownership of existing installed cask artifacts](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14033).
- [`ospack install --dry-run` allows viewing what `ospack install` will do before it is run](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13706).
- [`ospack docs` opens](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13844) [docs.ospack.github.io](https://docs.ospack.github.io).
- [`--cask` is never required on Linux](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14206).
- [`service do` blocks allow defining a `run` command per platform](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14371).
- [`ospack install` uses the local cache while installing dependencies from `pip`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14239).
- [`ospack doctor` no longer complains about BitDefender](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14300).
- [`ospack install` will also suggest casks rather than just formulae when it fails to find the requested package](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14240).
- [`ospack readall` simulates all architecture and OS configurations for better reliability](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13990).
- [`git` partial clones with sparse checkouts are supported when downloading using `git`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14035).
- [GCC 12 is used for runtime libraries to match Ubuntu 22.04, where we build our bottles](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13882).
- [`ospack doctor --quiet` prints no output on success](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14515).
- [`ospack gist-logs` better detects missing permissions](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14523).
- [`ospack update` uses the GitHub API token if available to avoid hitting rate limits](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14349).
- [We have discontinued WSL 1 support and recommend WSL 2 instead](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14000).
- [`ospack fetch` and `ospack install` can automatically determine mirrors for `glibc-bootstrap` and PyPI resources](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13875).

Finally:

- Ospack is now on Mastodon: [@ospack@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@ospack).
- [Our governance documents have been updated as part of our AGM](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14482).
- [We have switched from HackerOne](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14132) to [GitHub for vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/security/advisories/new).
- [Ospack accepts donations through GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Ospack) and [still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ospack). If you can afford it, please consider donating. If you'd rather not use GitHub Sponsors or Patreon (our preferred donation methods), [check out the other ways to donate in our README](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/#donations).
- Ospack had our first stand at FOSDEM 2023 in which the Project Leader was forced to wear a stupid beer suit.

Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far.
