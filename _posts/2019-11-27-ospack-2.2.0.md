Today I'd like to announce Ospack 2.2.0. The most significant changes since 2.1.0 are macOS Catalina support, performance increases and better Ospack on Linux ecosystem integration.

Major changes and deprecations since 2.1.0:

- [macOS Catalina (10.15) is supported. macOS Sierra (10.12) and older are unsupported.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/6500)
- [The no-op case for OSPACK_AUTO_UPDATE_SECS is dramatically faster and defaults to 5 minutes (rather than 1).](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/6532)
- [`ospack upgrade` no longer has an unsuccessful error code if the formula is up-to-date.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/6728)
- [`ospack upgrade`'s post-install dependent checking is dramatically faster and more reliable.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/6698)
- [Ospack on Linux raised their minimum requirements.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/6137)
- <https://formulae.ospack.github.io> [displays Linux formulae](https://github.com/Ospack/formulae.ospack.github.io/pull/150). When on Linux, [`ospack info` outputs Linux analytics data](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/6639).
- Ospack now uses OpenSSL 1.1. OpenSSL 1.0 has been removed as it was EOL by the end of 2019.
- Ospack will remove Python 2.7 by the end of 2019 as it will be EOL.
- [`ospack tap-pin` is disabled](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/6704). It was buggy and unused by Ospack maintainers. Directly reference formulae (e.g. `ospack install user/tap/formula`) or rename formulae in taps to avoid shadowing Ospack/ospack-core formulae instead.

Other changes since 2.1.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [`ospack bundle` outputs `Brewfile.lock.json` files for debugging non-reproducibility.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack-bundle/pull/552)
- [`ospack bundle` allows skipping installations by setting environment variables.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack-bundle/pull/486)
- [`sudo ospack services` takes root ownership of files when running as root.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack-services/pull/188)
- [`--verbose` command output no longer outputs (extremely) long $LOAD_PATH and Ruby paths.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/6705)
- [Ospack uses Ruby 2.6](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/6556)
- [`ospack cat` sets `bat` as pager if `OSPACK_BAT` is set](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/6504)
- `ospack create` has [`--rust`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/6489) and [`--python`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/6485) options.
- `ospack audit` checks [bitbucket.com](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/6425) and [gitlab.com](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/6272) repositories for notability.
- Ospack uses [GitHub Actions CI](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/6372) for all non-core repositories.
- [`uses_from_macos`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/6162) is a new formula DSL that allows formulae to declare that they use a dependency from the macOS system (rather than from Ospack). This is useful for additional metadata and automatically installing that dependency on Linux.
- Setting [`OSPACK_CURL_RETRIES`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/6143) retries `curl` downloads that fail.
- [`ospack bump-revision`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/5961) increases the `revision` of formulae.
- [All invocations of `ospack` are faster.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/6032)

Finally:

- Many Ospack maintainers will be attending [FOSDEM 2020](https://fosdem.org/2020/) (say hello!) and will have our AGM afterwards on 3rd February to elect a PLC and Project Leader.
- [Ospack now accepts donations through GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Ospack) and [still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ospack). If you can afford it, please consider donating. If you'd rather not use GitHub Sponsors or Patreon (our preferred donation methods), [check out the other ways to donate in our README](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/#donations).

Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far. Enjoy using Ospack!
