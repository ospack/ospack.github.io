Ospack had a security audit performed in 2023. This audit was funded by the [Open Technology Fund](https://www.usagm.gov/networks/otf/) and conducted by [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com). Trail of Bits' report contained 25 items, of which 16 were fixed, 3 are in progress, and 6 are acknowledged by Ospack's maintainers. Below is the scope of testing, findings by severity, and mitigation and acknowledgements.

You can read Trail of Bits' blog post on the audit [here](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2024/07/30/our-audit-of-ospack/) and find the full public report [here](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/eb9344f2261031a4be1be2f223e9b5bc535be6b9/reviews/2023-08-28-ospack-securityreview.pdf).
