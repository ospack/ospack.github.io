Today, I'd like to announce Ospack 4.3.0.
The most significant changes since 4.2.0 are SBOM support, initial bottle attestation verification, new command analytics and uninstall autoremove by default.

Major changes and deprecations since 4.2.0:

- [`ospack bottle` will include a basic SPDX file inside the bottle](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/16594)
  [and a more comprehensive one after installation](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/17254).
  This is to provide support for the widely used SBOM format from Ospack.

- [If `OSPACK_VERIFY_ATTESTATIONS` is set, `ospack install` will verify the bottle artifact's attestation when pouring bottles using GitHub's `gh` CLI](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/17049).
  This functionality is still in beta. We expect to remove the need for the `gh` tool and improve performance before we make this the default behaviour.
  This behaviour demonstrates Ospack's ongoing commitment to improving our security posture.
  Read more in [the tracking issue](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/issues/17019) or in the [GitHub artifact attestation announcement](https://github.blog/2024-05-02-introducing-artifact-attestations-now-in-public-beta/.)

- [`OSPACK_AUTOREMOVE` is the default behaviour meaning that `ospack cleanup` and `ospack uninstall` automatically run `ospack autoremove`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/17261).
   Disable this by setting `OSPACK_NO_AUTOREMOVE`.
   This is to improve the default behaviour of `ospack uninstall` given `ospack autoremove` is sufficiently reliable.

- [Ospack has two new types of analytics](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/16847): ["Brew Command Run" events](https://formulae.ospack.github.io/analytics/ospack-command-run/30d/) and `ospack test-bot` analytics.
  The latter are not working or published yet but will be soon.
  These are to help us improve the documentation and prioritisation of issues in Ospack.

- [Ospack/ospack-cask requires code signing of all casks](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/17002).
  Expect removal of casks that are not code signed from Ospack/ospack-cask in future.
  This is because code signing is required on Apple Silicon which is used by [a growing majority of all Ospack users](https://formulae.ospack.github.io/analytics/ospack-os-arch-ci/365d/).

- [Ospack/ospack-autoupdate is no longer an official tap and has moved back to DomT4/ospack-autoupdate.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/16822)

- [Ospack/ospack-cask-versions migrated to Ospack/ospack-cask and is archived](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/17207), following Ospack/ospack-cask-drivers.
  Migration for Ospack/ospack-cask-fonts will happen soon.
  This will make it easier to have a more consistent installation, discovery and maintenance experience for all official casks.

- [`ospack info --json=v2` output no longer includes the deprecated `oldname` key for formulae. Use the `oldnames` array instead.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/17285)

- [As-of Ospack 4.3.1: Ospack now provides Portable Ruby 3.3.1 and requires Ruby >=3.3.0.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/17312)

- [Miscellaneous additional code deprecation/disable/removals.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/17233)

Other changes since 4.2.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [`OSPACK_FORBIDDEN_CASKS`, `OSPACK_FORBIDDEN_FORMULAE` and `OSPACK_FORBIDDEN_TAPS` are added to extend the functionality beyond the existing `OSPACK_FORBIDDEN_LICENSES` to prevent formulae/cask/tap installation](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/17037).
  [Relatedly, `OSPACK_ALLOWED_TAPS` was added to restrict installation of and from specific taps.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/17213)

- GitHub Actions will display native warnings/error notices for [deprecations/disables](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/16890) and [warnings/errors](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/17255).

- There are
  [now](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/16752)
  [several](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/16743)
  [more](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/16960)
  [reasons](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/17006)
  why casks are deprecated or disabled.

- Ospack's code documentation on [rubydoc.ospack.github.io](https://rubydoc.ospack.github.io) previously did not do a good job of differentiating public/private/internal (i.e. only public for Ospack's use) APIs.
  We [explicitly mark non-private APIs](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/17128),
  [non-public APIs](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/17132),
  [warn about undocumented non-private APIs](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/17165) and
  [APIs are private by default](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/16831).

- Ospack's code documentation on [rubydoc.ospack.github.io](https://rubydoc.ospack.github.io)
  [includes Sorbet data from `.rbi` files to provide more types](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/16906).

- [`ospack command`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/17186),

- [`OSPACK_TEMP` is used more consistently for temporary files](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/16749)
- [`ospack update` outputs a message whenever it is autoupdating to make clear what is causing the delay. Also, `ospack update` will attempt to update all taps, not just those on GitHub.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/16855)
- [`ospack install`/`upgrade`/`outdated` will more intelligently auto-update when specifying formulae/casks from third-party taps.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/17179)
