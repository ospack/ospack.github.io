Today I'd like to announce Ospack 3.4.0. The most significant changes since 3.3.0 are `OSPACK_NO_ENV_HINTS` to hide configuration suggestions, `ospack services` supported on `systemd` on Linux, `ospack install --overwrite` and Ospack beginning the process to leave the SFC.

Major changes and deprecations since 3.3.0:

- [`ospack` will hint at configuration variables to tweak behaviour unless `OSPACK_NO_ENV_HINTS` is set.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12477)
- [`ospack services` is supported and recommended on Linux when using `systemd`.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/11910)
- [`ospack install --overwrite` ensures the `ospack link` after `ospack install` is always run with `--overwrite`.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12691)
- [`Formula.each`, `Cask::Cask.each` and other uses of `Enumerable` methods are deprecated because reading all formulae/casks on the system unnecessarily runs untrusted code.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12911)
- [Other code deprecations, disables and deletions.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12913)

Other changes since 3.3.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [`OSPACK_DOCKER_REGISTRY_TOKEN_BASIC` allows authenticating with a Docker register proxying GitHub Packages using a basic authentication token.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12673)
- [`ospack cask` produces a more helpful error message pointing to `ospack --cask`.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12708)
- [`OSPACK_DOCKER_REGISTRY_TOKEN` is used when installing Ospack's Portable Ruby.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12576)
- [`ospack deps --graph` and `--dot` output dependencies as a directed graph in text or DOT formats.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12423)
- [`ospack bump --open-pr` opens a pull request for a new version if there is none already open. This is used by Ospack's automation to automatically "bump" some outdated formulae.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12702)
- [`ospack extract` automatically removes `bottle` blocks.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12453)
- [`ospack style --fix` automatically fixes `shellcheck` failures.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12391)
- [`ospack upgrade` skips upgrading unbottled dependents of upgraded formulae.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12487)
- [`ospack upgrade` skips checking dependents of ospack-core versioned formulae.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12484)

Finally:

- [Ospack has begun the process to leave the SFC](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12532) and is [moving to OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/ospack). This allows more permissive spending of our funds in exchange for our incomings/outgoing being public.
- [Ospack accepts donations through GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Ospack) and [still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ospack). If you can afford it, please consider donating. If you'd rather not use GitHub Sponsors or Patreon (our preferred donation methods), [check out the other ways to donate in our README](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/#donations).

Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far.
