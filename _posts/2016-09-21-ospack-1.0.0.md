Today I'm proud to announce Ospack 1.0.0. In the seven years since Ospack was created by [@mxcl](https://github.com/mxcl) our community has grown to [almost 6000 unique contributors](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack-core/graphs/contributors), a [wide-reaching third-party "tap" ecosystem](https://github.com/search?p=2&q=ospack-&type=Repositories&utf8=âœ“) and [thousands of packages](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack-core/tree/master/Formula).

We've been working hard over the last year to make some major changes to Ospack that we've been wanting for a long time. There have been some hiccups along the way but we now have a more stable base for using and developing Ospack in the future.

These include:

- [Ospack package management and formulae (package metadata) split into separate repositories](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2)
- [Ospack Community site (using Discourse) for discussion](https://discourse.ospack.github.io)
- [Ospack joined the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2016/feb/22/ospack-joins/)
- [Ospack's default repository installation location changed to `/usr/local/Ospack` to keep your `/usr/local` cleaner](https://github.com/Ospack/install/pull/60)
- [Ospack/ospack updates between release tags](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/998)
- [Ospack CI and ospack/core use the macOS sandbox for build-time security](https://github.com/Ospack/legacy-ospack/pull/38361)
- [Ospack Cask integrated into Ospack/ospack](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/725)

- [Add `ospack --help` to `ospack` subcommands](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10)
- [Ospack auto-updates when needed](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/50)
- [`ospack update` sped up by only running `git fetch` if necessary](https://github.com/Ospack/legacy-ospack/pull/49219)
- Officially support [`ospack bundle`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack-bundle) (for `Brewfile`s and import/export) and [`ospack services`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack-services) (for background services management).
- [Ospack/ospack passes tests on Linux and has generic backend for porting to other platforms in future](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/168)
- [Provide access to developer commands and `ospack update` workflow automatically](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/881)
- [Use `curl` for all HTTP access for consistent proxy support](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/295)
- Use [new Ruby Macho library](https://github.com/Ospack/ruby-macho) for reading and writing library macOS Mach O file locations.
- [Provide vendored, portable Ruby 2 binary for when system Ruby 2 is not available](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/404)
- [`HEAD` package installations have versions and can be upgraded](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/584)
- [Use Python virtualenvs to better handle Python dependencies](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/344)
