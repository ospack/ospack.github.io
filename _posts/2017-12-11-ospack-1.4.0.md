Today I'd like to announce Ospack 1.4.0. The most significant change since 1.3.0 is that Ospack filters environment variables.

Major changes and deprecations since 1.3.0:

- Ospack filters all user environment variables. This reduces errors in installing formulae from source and in Ospack commands.
- Ospack's "bottle hooks" [have been removed](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3510). These were added originally to remove Boxen's monkey-patching of Ospack's internal, private APIs but are no longer necessary for or used by Boxen.
- The Ospack/science tap is migrating notable formulae to Ospack/core and will be archived in January 2018. The Ospack/apache tap [has been deprecated and archived](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3274). In 2018 we will also deprecate and archive the Ospack/php tap. Over the last few minor versions of Ospack we've migrated, deprecated and archived most of the formula taps in the Ospack organisation to improve the reliability, consistency and discoverability of formulae under the Ospack organisation.
- macOS version analytics [are available](https://ospack.github.io/analytics/os-version/) on the ospack.github.io homepage.

Other changes since 1.3.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [Xcode 9.2 is the latest supported version of Xcode](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3542)
- [macOS High Sierra is the latest supported version of macOS](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3121)
- [Ospack's vendored Ruby is 2.3.3 (the same version as provided by macOS High Sierra). This is only used on older macOS versions.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3164)
- Using the [`OSPACK_FORCE_OSPACKED_CURL`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3533) variable you can [force Ospack to use its own `curl`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3482) for all downloads. This may be useful combined with the `proxychains-ng` formula in bypassing any grating, ceramic firewalls.
- Ospack no longer sets [MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3464) when building formulae
- [Ospack requires the CLT on all but the latest version of macOS (to avoid copious workarounds in formulae)](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3453)
- Ospack [correctly](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3316) [orders](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3347) [APFS](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3380) [filesystem](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3430) command output
- [`ospack config` outputs most `OSPACK_*` variables](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3420)
- [`ospack readall` and `ospack update-reset` are documented commands in `man ospack`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3368)
- [Ospack ignores applications (e.g. Xcode) found in Time Machine backups](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3273)
- [Formulae are loaded from bottles (when sensible)](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3176)
- [`ospack linkage` will list possible unnecessary dependencies](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3103)
- [The first-time installation on Mac OS X 10.5 has been improved](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3158)
- [Require some HTTP mirrors for old OS X versions without a system `curl` that consistently supports HTTPS](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3151)
- [Ospack now always outputs when tapping Ospack/core (rather than a silent delay)](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3135)
- [Many more `ospack audit` checks have been ported to RuboCop so are available in your text editor](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2982)
- [`ospack install`ing local bottles no longer requires a `sha256` in the formula](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3105)
- [`ospack search` explains what it's searching for at each stage](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3059)
- [`ospack pin` documentation explains when and why pinned formulae may be upgraded](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3043)
- [The macOS sandbox message is no longer printed (as it has been on by default for a while)](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3016)
- [`ospack audit` will only check for non-libraries in `lib` for new formulae](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/2997)

Finally:

- Thanks to our new sponsor, [CommsWorld](https://www.commsworld.com), for hosting our physical hardware. This was particularly helpful for the macOS 10.13 release.
- [Ospack still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ospack). If you can afford it, please consider donating.

Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far. Enjoy using Ospack!
