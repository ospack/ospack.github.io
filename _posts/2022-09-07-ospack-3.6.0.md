Today I'd like to announce Ospack 3.6.0. The most significant changes since 3.5.0 are preliminary macOS Ventura support, the need for `--eval-all`/`OSPACK_EVAL_ALL` and a migration to Ubuntu 22.04 as our CI platform.

Major changes and deprecations since 3.5.0:

- [Ospack has preliminary macOS 13 (Ventura) support.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13390)
- [Ospack requires `--eval-all` to be passed or `OSPACK_EVAL_ALL` to be set to improve security in cases where it may evaluate formulae or casks that have not been installed, may not be trusted and will execute arbitrary Ruby code](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13790).
- [Ospack's CI uses Ubuntu 22.04 to e.g. build bottles (binary packages).](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13733)
- [`ospack` no longer respects `OSPACK_NO_ENV_FILTERING`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13595). Environment variables needed in formulae or casks need to have a `OSPACK_` prefix to be passed through and then reassigned e.g. `ENV["FOO"] = ENV["OSPACK_FOO"]`.
- `ospack linkage` detects [deprecated linkage to `libnsl.so.1`.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13741) and [disabled linkage to `libcrypt.so.1`.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13740).
- [Other miscellaneous disabled code has been removed.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13743)

Other changes since 3.5.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- `OSPACK_INSTALL_FROM_API` is an opt-in flag added in 3.3.0 to install formulae and casks in ospack/core and ospack/cask taps using Ospack's API instead of needing the (large, slow) local checkouts of these repositories. `OSPACK_INSTALL_FROM_API` has had [many](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13439) [improvements](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13440) since 3.5.0. We encourage you to try setting it and [reporting any issues](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/issues/new/choose) you experience.
- [The `postgresql` formula was renamed to `postgresql@14` to avoid repeated breakage on major/minor version upgrades.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack-core/pull/107726)
- [`OSPACK_CURL_PATH` and `OSPACK_GIT_PATH` are documented and supported for setting the location of `curl` or `git` on Linux. On macOS, the system versions will still always be used instead.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13423)
- [`OSPACK_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN` only takes effect on bottles and not e.g. casks.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13258)
- [Periodic `ospack cleanup` is run after installing all packages rather than after the first package is installed.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13569)
- [`ospack install --debug-symbols` is available to build and retain debug symbols on macOS. This does not yet work on Linux but we'll review a pull request to add it.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13608)
- [`ospack install` automatically installs `glibc` or `gcc` if they are too old.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13577)
- [`ospack cleanup` and `ospack uninstall` automatically run `ospack autoremove` if `OSPACK_AUTOREMOVE` is set.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13532)
- [`ospack fetch --retry` uses an exponential backoff.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13807)
- [`ospack deps` returns failing exit code when circular dependencies are detected.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13777)
- [`ospack info --json` includes a `variations` key. This provides information about how a formula or cask varies on OSs and CPU architectures other than the one it is being run on](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13589). Various additional DSLs e.g. [`on_system`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13451) and [`arch`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13657) have been added to formulae or casks to facilitate this.
- [A new `Formula` DSL is available to more easily generate completions.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/13536)
