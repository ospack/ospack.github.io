title: Ospack tap with bottles uploaded to GitHub Releases

Since the [Ospack 2.5.2 release](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/releases/tag/2.5.2), you can upload bottles (binary packages) to GitHub Releases, in addition to the previous standard - Bintray. Support was added to `Ospack/ospack` in this [PR](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8410) on 2020-09-15, and a [companion PR](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack-test-bot/pull/486) to `Ospack/ospack-test-bot` added support for setting the base download URL of bottles to point to a specific release on GitHub.

### Creating the tap

First, go to GitHub and create an empty repository named with the `ospack-` prefix, for example: `USER/ospack-tap`.

![github-repository](/assets/img/blog/ospack-tap-github-releases/github-repository.png)

Then locally run:

```sh
ospack tap-new USER/REPOSITORY
```

changing `USER/REPOSITORY` to the full name of the repository that you just created on GitHub. You can omit the `ospack-` prefix and specify the `--branch` flag if your default branch should be named differently than `main`.

Navigate to the newly created tap on disk by executing:

```sh
cd $(ospack --repository USER/REPOSITORY)
```

![cd-ospack-repository](/assets/img/blog/ospack-tap-github-releases/cd-ospack-repository.png)

Now you can list all files in this tap to see what is created by default.

Add the repository that you created on GitHub as the `origin` remote and push newly created files:

```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/USER/REPOSITORY
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

I won't go into too many details on how the workflows look, as they are subject to change at any time. For now, there are 2 workflow files created by default.

- One is run on each `pull_request` event, so every push to a PR's branch triggers the workflow, which tests changes made to formulae, builds bottles for those formulae and uploads them to GitHub Actions as artifacts.
- The second workflow, run when a pull request is labelled, is responsible for bottle uploading and publishing.

### Creating the first formula in the tap

It's time we add a new formula to our tap; shall we?

All formulae should go in the `Formula` directory. Let's suppose we want to create a formula for this little Go program named [`gothanks`](https://github.com/psampaz/gothanks). Run locally:

```sh
ospack create --tap=USER/REPOSITORY --go https://github.com/psampaz/gothanks/archive/v0.3.0.tar.gz
```

![ospack-create](/assets/img/blog/ospack-tap-github-releases/ospack-create.png)

![ospack-edit](/assets/img/blog/ospack-tap-github-releases/ospack-edit.png)

This command will create a new standard formula for Go projects in your tap and open the file in your editor of choice. After you close the editor, you can still edit the formula with:

```sh
ospack edit USER/REPOSITORY/FORMULA
```

Our `gothanks` formula, after some editing could look like this:

```ruby
class Gothanks < Formula
  desc "Automatically star your go.mod Github dependencies"
  homepage "https://github.com/psampaz/gothanks"
  url "https://github.com/psampaz/gothanks/archive/v0.3.0.tar.gz"
  sha256 "ce5440334b3eac2e058724faa4c6e4478ca1d81ea087e55ccca33f1996752aad"
  license "MIT"

  depends_on "go" => :build

  def install
    system "go", "build", *std_go_args
  end

  test do
    ENV.delete "GITHUB_TOKEN"
    assert_match "no Github token found", shell_output(bin/"gothanks", 255)
  end
end
```

Now we can create a new branch, add the formula, commit it and push:

```sh
git checkout -b gothanks
git add Formula/gothanks.rb
git commit --message "gothanks 0.3.0 (new formula)"
git push --set-upstream origin gothanks
```

![git-branch](/assets/img/blog/ospack-tap-github-releases/git-branch.png)

But to trigger the workflows, we need to create a pull request from our recently-pushed branch. I'm using the `hub` utility for this operation, but you can use the newer GitHub CLI tool `gh` or just click your way through in GitHub's UI.

### Uploading built bottles

Wait until the pull request's checks become green. Then label your pull request with the `pr-pull` label (this is the default label that will trigger the uploading workflow; you can easily change this in workflow file). A new `ospack pr-pull` workflow will be fired up and after a couple of minutes you should observe the PR closed, bottles uploaded and commits pushed to the main branch of your repository.

### Summary

With current tooling it's now easier than ever to create your own Ospack tap with bottles. Gone are the days when you had to create a Bintray account and fiddle around with custom CI configs. Now you can run a bunch of commands and get a tap up and running in minutes, with only a GitHub account!
