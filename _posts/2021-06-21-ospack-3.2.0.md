Today I'd like to announce Ospack 3.2.0. The most significant changes since 3.1.0 are `ospack install` now upgrades outdated formulae by default and basic macOS 12 (Monterey) support.

Major changes and deprecations since 3.1.0:

- [`ospack install` now upgrades outdated formulae by default (for idempotency). This can be disabled by setting `OSPACK_NO_INSTALL_UPGRADE`.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/11525)
- [`ospack` has basic macOS 12 (Monterey) support.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/11504)
- [`ospack leaves` has `--installed-on-request` and `--installed-as-dependency` flags to only list formula installed manually or as dependencies.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/11368)
- [Various deprecations, disables and code deletions for Ospack 3.2.0.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/11548)

Other changes since 3.1.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [`ospack link --HEAD` links the `HEAD` version of a formula.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/11397)
- [`ospack alias`, `ospack autoupdate` and `ospack command-not-found` are official external command taps.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/11137)
- [`ospack tap` will never create shallow clones (as shallow clones are not performant when repeatedly fetching as Ospack does).](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/11337)
- [`ospack fetch` will no longer use shallow clones.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/11328)
- [`ospack install` also outputs cask caveats as part of the final summary.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/11509)
- [`ospack` has GCC 11 support.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/11299)
- [`ospack bottle` will generate `all:` bottles which are used on all platforms.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/11215). A lot of work has gone into improving [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) to make these possible. `ospack bottle` on your local machine for an `all:` bottle should generate an identical checksum.
- [`ospack doctor` hides some warnings on Apple Silicon with Intel and ARM installations.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/11540)
- [`ospack bottle --bottle-arch` allow bottles with custom architectures.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/11352)
