Today I'd like to announce Ospack 3.3.0. The most significant changes since 3.2.0 are the migration from Ospack/linuxospack-core to [Ospack/ospack-core](https://github.com/ospack/ospack-core) for all Ospack on Linux users, the official support of macOS Monterey (and, as usual, dropping the support for Mojave due to us only supporting 3 macOS versions) and the addition of an opt-in `OSPACK_INSTALL_FROM_API` flag to avoid needing to have Ospack/ospack-core or Ospack/ospack-cask repositories tapped/cloned locally.

Major changes and deprecations since 3.2.0:

- [`ospack update` will migrate all Linux users from linuxospack-core to ospack-core. This will also trigger the upgrade of some formulae installed from linuxospack-core due to `revision` differences.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12248)
- [macOS Monterey is officially supported](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12263) and [requires Xcode 13.1](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12262). Monterey ships with Ruby 2.6.8 so we've released and use [Portable Ruby 2.6.8](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12281).
- [`OSPACK_INSTALL_FROM_API` is a new opt-in flag to install formulae and casks in ospack/core and ospack/cask taps using Ospack's API instead of needing the (large, slow) local checkouts of these repositories.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12305)
- [`ospack bump-formula-pr --write` has been deprecated in favour of `ospack bump-formula-pr --write-only`.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12223)
- [The Internet Archive uploader was broken and no-one noticed so it has been removed.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12130)
- [Various additional deprecations, disables and code removals.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/12259)

Other changes since 3.2.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [`ospack install`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/11963) and [`ospack upgrade`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/11940) will fetch all formulae before attempting installation.
- [`ospack install` outputs all cask installations at the end (like formulae).](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/11966)
