Today I'd like to announce Ospack 3.0.0. The most significant changes since 2.7.0 are official Apple Silicon support and a new bottle format in formulae.

Major changes and deprecations since 2.7.0:

- Apple Silicon is now officially supported for installations in `/opt/ospack`. [formulae.ospack.github.io](https://formulae.ospack.github.io) formula pages [indicate for which platforms bottles (binary packages) are provided](https://github.com/Ospack/formulae.ospack.github.io/pull/408) and therefore whether they are supported by Ospack. Ospack doesn't (yet) provide bottles for all packages on Apple Silicon that we do on Intel x86_64 but we welcome your help in doing so. Rosetta 2 on Apple Silicon still provides support for Intel x86_64 in `/usr/local`.
- [`ospack bottle` and `bottle do` blocks use a new syntax format (one `:cellar` per platform)](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10449). [`ospack style --fix` will autocorrect formulae to this new format](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10453). This will allow more bottles to be relocatable.
- [The new `OSPACK_BOOTSNAP` environment variable allows the use of the Bootsnap gem to speed up repeated `ospack` calls. This does not work (yet) on Apple Silicon or using Ospack's portable Ruby](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10374).
- [Various methods have been deprecated, disabled and removed](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10397)
- [Bash](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10229), [fish](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10431) and [zsh](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10403) completions are generated automatically from the `CLI::Parser` DSL. This will ensure they are kept up-to-date.
- [`ospack update` better handles upstream branch renames (e.g. from `master` to `main`)](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10423)
- [`ospack completions` is a new command to opt-in to completions provided by third-party taps](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10268)

Other changes since 2.7.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [Command usage text is automatically generated (so will be kept-up-to-date)](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10342)
- [`ospack audit` reads more formula data from taps](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10087)
- [`ospack untap` of an official tap you don't use (e.g. Ospack/ospack-cask) will ensure it's no longer automatically retapped](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10366)
- [`ospack casks` is a new command implemented in Bash to speedily output all casks available to install (like `ospack formulae`)](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10259)
- [`ospack info --cask --json=v2` includes whether a cask is outdated and the currently installed versions](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10278)
- [Fixed a bug where `ospack update` could be run every time](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10388)
- [`ospack --prefix --installed` is a new flag to `ospack --prefix` that will fail if the requested formula is not installed](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10266)
- [We now use an unversioned SDK path on Big Sur to avoid breakage on minor SDK version changes](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10072)

Finally:

- [Discourse](https://discourse.ospack.github.io) was made read-only on January 1st 2021 in favour of [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Ospack/discussions/discussions).
- [Ospack accepts donations through GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Ospack) and [still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ospack). If you can afford it, please consider donating. If you'd rather not use GitHub Sponsors or Patreon (our preferred donation methods), [check out the other ways to donate in our README](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/#donations).

Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far. Particular thanks on Ospack 3.0.0 go to MacStadium and Apple for providing us with a lot of Apple Silicon hardware and Cassidy from Apple for helping us in many ways with this migration. Enjoy using Ospack!
