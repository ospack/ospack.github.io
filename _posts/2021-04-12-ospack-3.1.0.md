Today I'd like to announce Ospack 3.1.0. The most significant change since 3.0.0 is the migration of our bottles (binary packages) to GitHub Packages.

Major changes and deprecations since 3.0.0:

- [GitHub Packages is the default package download/upload location on macOS](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/11070) [and Linux](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/11073). This is due to Bintray's shutdown on May 1st 2021.
- [Various deprecated, disabled and deleted code.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/11075)
- [The undocumented `OSPACK_NO_ENV_FILTERING` flag is deprecated and will be removed.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10778)

- [The `OSPACK_NO_BOTTLE_SOURCE_FALLBACK` is removed (as its behaviour is now the default).](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10640)
- [GitHub Packages writes bottles' tabs into the GitHub Packages manifest JSON. `ospack bottle --only-json-tab` has been added to allow future GitHub Packages bottles to store their tab outside the bottle to allow reproducible builds.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10948) [This is why downloads from GitHub Packages also include a small manifest JSON download.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10977) [This also allows future creation of `all: SHA256` bottles for bottles shared across all platforms.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/11077)

Other changes since 3.0.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [The `sed` superenv shim is removed.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10802)
- [CodeCov in Ospack's GitHub Actions no longer requires a hardcoded token.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10514)
- [`ospack update --quiet` is a bit quieter.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10868)
- [`ospack update` outputs to `stderr` when not outputting to a TTY to ease `stdout` usage.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10501)
- [`ospack update` reports outdated formulae and suggests `ospack upgrade`.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10581)
- [`installed_on_request` is correctly set in the tab for dependencies again. This will improve usage of `ospack bundle dump` after reinstalling packages.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10681)
- [Ospack does not load non-Bundler gems to prevent issues from user-installed gems.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10695)
- [Ospack's default `ruby` warning level is now `-W1` (to avoid hiding legitimate warnings.)](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10598)
- [`ospack cask` `pkg` uninstallation is faster.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10954)
- [`ospack --prefix <formula>` is faster.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10693)
- [`ospack --version` is faster.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10771)
- [`ospack list` also uses `ls` for casks output (to be consistent with formulae).](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10945)
- [`ospack list` visually separates formulae and casks.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10899)
- [`ospack bump` supports casks.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10635)
- [`service do` is a new formula DSL to allow plists to be easily generated.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/9517)
- [Always require developer tools on Apple Silicon (because `codesign` is needed when pouring bottles).](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10533)
- [When `codesign` fails more error output is now printed.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10590)
- [`gem`, `rake` and `ruby` superenv shims are provided to work around broken macOS `ruby`s.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10595)
- [A better error message is output when users don't have any GitHub API credentials set.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10535)

Finally:

- Ospack's Annual General Meeting in February elected a [new Project Leadership Committee, Technical Steering Committee, and I (Mike McQuaid) was re-elected as Project Leader](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack#who-we-are)
- [Ospack accepts donations through GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Ospack) and [still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ospack). If you can afford it, please consider donating. If you'd rather not use GitHub Sponsors or Patreon (our preferred donation methods), [check out the other ways to donate in our README](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/#donations).

Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far. Particular thanks on Ospack 3.1.0 go to GitHub for providing GitHub Packages and helping in our migration. Enjoy using Ospack!
