Today I'd like to announce Ospack 1.5.0. The most significant changes since 1.4.0 are deprecations of formula APIs and some Ospack organisation formula taps.

Future dates for your calendar:

- On 1st March 2018 the `python` formula will be upgraded to Python 3.x and a `python@2` formula will be added for installing Python 2.7 (although this will be keg-only so neither `python` nor `python2` will be added to the `PATH` by default without a manual `ospack link --force`). We will maintain `python2`, `python3` and `python@3` aliases. Any formulae that use `depends_on "python"` outside [Ospack/core](https://github.com/ospack/ospack-core) will need to be updated at this point if they wish to keep using Python 2. Note: macOS has provided Python 2.7 since OS X Lion (10.7) so you can update formulae that need Python 2 today by removing `depends_on "python"` so they use the system `python` instead.
- By 31st March 2018 we will deprecate and archive the Ospack/ospack-php tap. Unfortunately we have been unable to maintain an acceptable, consistent user or contributor experience and CI workload through non-core formula taps in the Ospack organisation so we are continuing to migrate widely used formulae into [Ospack/core](https://github.com/ospack/ospack-core) and encourage more niche formulae and options to be supported outside the Ospack organisation.

Major changes and deprecations since 1.4.0:

- The Ospack/ospack-science tap has been archived (for the reasons explained above) as [noted previously](https://ospack.github.io/2017/12/11/ospack-1.4.0/). This does not represent an adversarial relationship between Ospack and the science community (as we have imported the widely used formulae from this tap) but an inability to maintain an acceptable level of quality in this tap and differences of opinion on contributor experience (this tap aimed to work on Ospack and Linuxospack which made contribution difficult).
- [`ospack postgresql-upgrade-database` is a new command to simplify upgrading PostgreSQL databases between major versions](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack-core/blob/e0708e2a1a68a4ba7d826f9c6fc9fd21b29e5220/cmd/ospack-postgresql-upgrade-database.rb).
- [`default_formula` are no longer supported for `Requirement`s. This was originally added to ease our bottle/binary package building when Ospack was primarily a build-from-source package manager. Now that Ospack is primarily a binary package manager, `default_formula` was no longer useful and was the source of many complex dependency resolution bugs.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3661)
- [`Requirement`s that allowed you to use `depends_on` for software outside of Ospack that was also provided by Ospack have been deprecated. Instead formulae that wish to support e.g. a non-Ospack Python should use `env :std` and use the first instance of the software in the PATH (found with `which`)](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3659)
- [Various, old deprecated APIs have been disabled](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3694) and [more deprecations added](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3652).
- [`ospack reinstall` and `ospack upgrade` no longer keep manually `ospack unlink`ed kegs as unlinked on `reinstall` or `upgrade`. Without this change there was no way of differentiating manually unlinked and failed-to-link kegs so a single keg link failure would stop any future version trying to link (leading to the software unexpectedly being missing from the user's `PATH`).](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3660)

Other changes since 1.4.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [`ospack audit` allows the use of `env :std` in non-Ospack organisation taps](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3650)
- [`OSPACK_DEVELOPER`s are encouraged to submit pull requests for deprecations](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3691)
- [Attempting to `ospack install` a formula that doesn't exist will only check if the formula was deleted in the last month (rather than ever) to improve performance.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3614)
- [`ospack info` now shows `--devel` and `--HEAD` options for optionless formulae](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3693)
- [Ospack's portable Ruby has a GitHub mirror for users that cannot access Bintray](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3683)
- [`ospack upgrade` skips the formula rather than exiting if an upgrade fails due to an unsatisfied `Requirement`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3644)
- [The `no_proxy` variable is passed through to the Ospack fetch/install process (e.g. for `curl`)](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3584)

Finally:

- [Ospack has fewer maintainers than we once did so we'd love more help](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3676). If you're interested check out the [documented expectations for Ospack maintainers](https://docs.ospack.github.io/New-Maintainer-Checklist).
- [Ospack still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ospack). If you can afford it, please consider donating. If you'd rather not use Patreon we've [updated the README on how to make single donations through PayPal, cheque or wire transfer](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3568).

Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far. Enjoy using Ospack!
