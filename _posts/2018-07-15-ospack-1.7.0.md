Today I'd like to announce Ospack 1.7.0. The most significant changes since 1.7.0 are fixes for macOS 10.14 Mojave's developer beta, [Ospack Formulae's](https://formulae.ospack.github.io) JSON analytics and formulae APIs and various formula API deprecations.

Major changes and deprecations since 1.6.0:

- [macOS 10.14 Mojave](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/4274) and [Xcode 10](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/4275) are now working for some formulae (but not yet supported)
- [Ospack Formulae now uses HTTPS, provides anonymous aggregate analytics data and has a JSON API for formulae and analytics data](https://formulae.ospack.github.io)
- [Ospack Cask's taps have now all moved to the Ospack GitHub organisation](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/issues/4193)
- [Setting `OSPACK_FORCE_OSPACKED_GIT` makes Ospack use a Ospack-installed rather than system Git](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/4377)
- [`ospack install` and `upgrade` display all caveats at the end of installing multiple formulae](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/4361)
- [Many formula deprecations have been disabled and disabled functions removed](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/4392)
- [`ospack link` does not permit force-linking system dependencies on macOS 10.14 Mojave/CLT 10 and instead outputs the correct compiler flags to use](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/4441)
- [The `OSPACK_PREFIX` can no longer be in Ospack's temporary directory](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/4397)
- [`ospack ls` no longer accepts all `ls` arguments](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/4067)

Other changes since 1.6.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [Ospack now uses Ruby 2.3.7 (like macOS High Sierra 10.13.6)](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/4461)
- [macOS 10.14 Mojave currently requires the CLT header package (until we have more communication with Apple)](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/4334)
- [`ospack install`, `upgrade` and `reinstall` now have a `--display-times` option to print the install time for each formula](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/4359)
- [`ospack linkage` now uses a cache to dramatically speed up the command](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3720)
- [Unspecified but opportunistic linked dependencies are now stored on formula installation and used to correctly generate the list of dependencies for an installed formula](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3789)
- [Downloading Ospack's portable Ruby also respects the `OSPACK_BOTTLE_DOMAIN` variable](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/4389)
- [The ospack.github.io websites all look better on mobiles](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack.github.io/commit/9806592bbd3fb9bb85c83121ebdf892831515490)

Finally:

- [Ospack still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ospack). If you can afford it, please consider donating. If you'd rather not use Patreon we've [updated the README on how to make single donations through PayPal, cheque or wire transfer](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/3568).

Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far. Enjoy using Ospack!
