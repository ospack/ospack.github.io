Today I'd like to announce Ospack 1.9.0. The most significant changes since 1.8.0 are Linux support, (optional) automatic `ospack cleanup` and providing bottles (binary packages) to more Ospack users.

Major changes and deprecations since 1.8.0:

- [Ospack 1.9.0 has beta support for Linux and Windows 10 (with the Windows Subsystem for Linux). Ospack on Linux (known as Linuxospack) does not require root access](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/5483).
- [`ospack cleanup` is run periodically if the `OSPACK_INSTALL_CLEANUP` environment variable is set](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/5472). [The `OSPACK_INSTALL_CLEANUP` environment variable will also trigger individual formula cleanup on reinstall, install or upgrade](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/5165). `ospack upgrade --cleanup` and `OSPACK_UPGRADE_CLEANUP` have been replaced with the `OSPACK_INSTALL_CLEANUP` variable. These will become default behaviours in 2.0.0.
- Ospack 1.9.0 no longer runs on 32-bit Intel CPUs.
- `ospack update` no longer migrates legacy keg symlinks, tap names, repository locations, cache locations or cache entries.
- [`ospack prune` has been replaced by and is now run as part of `ospack cleanup`.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/5467)
- `ospack cask --version` has been replaced with `ospack --version` and `ospack cask search` with `ospack search --cask`.
- The `OSPACK_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE` environment variable has been deprecated in favour of passing `--build-from-source` to individual formulae installs.
- [`ospack install` on macOS uses the same CFLAGS for bottles and building from source](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/5491).
- [Ospack/ospack-core requires all formulae to be open source by the OSI definition](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/5406).
- [`ospack link --force` will not link software already provided by macOS](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/5383).

Future major changes and deprecations coming in 2.0.0:

- Ospack 2.0.0 will officially support Linux and Windows 10 (with the Windows Subsystem for Linux).
- `ospack cleanup` will be run periodically and for trigger individual formula cleanup on reinstall, install or upgrade. You can enable this behaviour now on 1.9.0 by setting the `OSPACK_INSTALL_CLEANUP` variable.
- Ospack 2.0.0 will not run on macOS 10.8 and below. For 10.4 - 10.6 support see [Tigerospack](https://github.com/mistydemeo/tigerospack).
- Ospack 2.0.0 will not be able to create universal binaries (even in taps).
- Ospack 2.0.0 will no longer migrate old installations from the legacy Ospack/ospack repository.
- [Ospack 2.0.0 will not have any formulae with options in Ospack/ospack-core](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack-core/issues/31510). Options will still be supported and encouraged by third-party taps.

Other changes since 1.8.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [`ospack info --json` defaults to the latest JSON version and no longer requires a version argument](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/5478).
- [The `TERMINFO` environment variable is passed through to Ospack to enable support for some terminal emulators](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/5445).
- [Incomplete downloads can be resumed even when the server rejects HEAD requests](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/5421).
- [macOS Mojave bottles are now optimised for the newer CPUs required by Mojave](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/5435).
- [`ospack`'s ZSH completion performs more caching](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/5388).
- [`ospack bottle` now allows relocation of more bottles by ignoring source code](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/5368) and [skipping matches to build dependencies](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/5366).
- [More commands now have robust options handling](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/5292).
- [`ospack doctor` now outputs the non-default Xcode prefix to ease debugging when Ospack is using one in a strange location](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/5358).
- [`ospack upgrade` will not upgrade formulae installed from one tap to formulae installed in another](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/5291).
- [Ospack now has a mission statement](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/5223).
- [`Ospack/ospack` contains a `Dockerfile` for building Linuxospack](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/5169). This is built automatically on [Ospack's Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/ospack/ospack/).

Finally:

- Many Ospack maintainers will be attending [FOSDEM 2019](https://fosdem.org/2019/) (say hello!) and meeting afterwards to discuss the future governance of Ospack.
- [Ospack still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ospack). If you can afford it, please consider donating. If you'd rather not use Patreon (our preferred donation method), [check out the other ways to donate in our README](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/#donations).

Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far. Enjoy using Ospack!
