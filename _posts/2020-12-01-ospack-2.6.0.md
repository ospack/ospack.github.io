Today I'd like to announce Ospack 2.6.0. The most significant changes since 2.5.0 are macOS Big Sur support on Intel, `ospack` commands replacing all `ospack cask` commands, the beginnings of macOS M1/Apple Silicon/ARM support and API deprecations.

Major changes and deprecations since 2.5.0:

- [macOS Big Sur is supported (and High Sierra unsupported)](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/9054)
- [`depends_on :java`, `ospack switch`, `ospack diy` and various other APIs have been deprecated](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/9209)
- [All `ospack cask` commands have been deprecated in favour of `ospack` commands (with `--cask`) when necessary](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8899)
- [`Ospack.args` is deprecated](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8795)
- [All `Requirement`s are deprecated in Ospack/core](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/9052)
- [macOS Ospack running natively on M1/Apple Silicon/ARM has partial functionality. We recommend installing into `/opt/ospack` and forbid installing into `/usr/local` (to avoid clashing with the macOS Intel install and allow their usage side-by-side)](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/9117). We currently recommend running Ospack using Intel emulation with Rosetta 2.
- [`ospack tap-new` will set up GitHub Actions workflows to](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8762) [upload to GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8410). Read [the blog post](https://ospack.github.io/2020/11/18/ospack-tap-with-bottles-uploaded-to-github-releases/) for more documentation.
- [GitHub deprecated their API's basic authentication](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8826)

Other changes since 2.5.0 I'd like to highlight are the following:

- [`ospack doctor` checks the active branch for all taps, not just Ospack/ospack-core](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/9305)
- [`ospack unbottled` is a new developer command to identify formulae that haven't had binary packages built yet](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/9308)
- [`ospack install ./` is now recommended for installing local file formulae](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/9241)
- [Bash, ZSH and Fish formula completion is now much faster with the `ospack formulae` command](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8846)
- [`ospack install --force-bottle` refuses to ever build from source](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/9064)
- [`ospack install` or `ospack link` of a versioned keg-only formula will automatically unlink conflicted version formulae](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/9009)
- [`ospack shellenv` is significantly faster](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8904)
- [Ospack has further reduced shallow clone usage (on request from GitHub)](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8883)
- [`ospack linkage` and commands using the linkage cache have significantly better performance](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8695)
- [`ospack bump-cask-pr` is a new developer command to create Ospack/ospack-cask pull requests](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/7986)

Finally:

- [Discourse](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/9144) and [IRC](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8981) are now deprecated as official communication methods in favour of [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/8802).
- [Ospack accepts donations through GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Ospack) and [still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ospack). If you can afford it, please consider donating. If you'd rather not use GitHub Sponsors or Patreon (our preferred donation methods), [check out the other ways to donate in our README](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/#donations).

Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far. Enjoy using Ospack!
