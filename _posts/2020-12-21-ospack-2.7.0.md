Today I'd like to announce Ospack 2.7.0. The most significant changes since 2.6.0 are API deprecations.

Changes and deprecations since 2.6.0:

- [The `prefix` DSL for bottles is deprecated. It was not actually used by the code.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/9482)
- [`deprecate!` and `disable!` in formulae with missing or non-ISO 8601 dates is deprecated.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/9478)
- [`depends_on :java`, `:x11`, `:osxfuse`, `:tuntap` are all deprecated in formulae and casks.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/9403)
- [Additional API deprecations, disables and removals.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/10056)

Finally:

- [Ospack accepts donations through GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Ospack) and [still accepts donations through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ospack). If you can afford it, please consider donating. If you'd rather not use GitHub Sponsors or Patreon (our preferred donation methods), [check out the other ways to donate in our README](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/#donations).

Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far. Enjoy using Ospack!
