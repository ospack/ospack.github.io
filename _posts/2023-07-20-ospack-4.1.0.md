Today, I'd like to announce Ospack 4.1.0. The most significant changes since 4.0.0 are significant improvements to the security/reliability/performance/usability of Ospack 4.0.0's new JSON API, the completion of the migration of analytics from Google Analytics in the US to InfluxDB in the EU and groundwork for later macOS Sonoma (14) support.

Major changes and deprecations since 4.0.0:

- [`ospack` downloads of formula/cask APIs use a signed API endpoint with client signature verification.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14733)
- We've made many improvements around the new 4.0.0 feature of using JSON files downloaded from [formulae.ospack.github.io](https://formulae.ospack.github.io) for package installation rather than local ospack/core and ospack/cask taps.
  - If you had previously set `OSPACK_NO_AUTO_UPDATE`, `OSPACK_NO_INSTALL_FROM_API` or `OSPACK_AUTO_UPDATE_SECS` to work around bugs or annoyances: please consider unsetting these and tweaking the values based on the new behaviour. Under some circumstances, [you may see a one-time message nudging you do to this](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14592).
- [`ospack doctor` warns if Ospack/ospack-core or Ospack/ospack-cask seem to be tapped unnecessarily so you can `ospack untap` them to save time and disk space.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/15341)
- [formulae.ospack.github.io](https://formulae.ospack.github.io) provides [new analytics for Ospack Developer Configuration, OS/Architecture/CI, Ospack Prefixes and Ospack Versions](https://formulae.ospack.github.io/analytics/). This is based on existing data that was already gathered.
- We destroyed (and did not migrate/back up) all of Ospack's Google Analytics data on 2023-06-16 and [all Google Analytics code has been removed.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/15550)
- Ospack's analytics are only sent to our InfluxDB instance hosted in the EU.
  - If you had previously set `OSPACK_NO_ANALYTICS` because you didn't like Google Analytics and/or data being sent to the US: please consider unsetting this allowing analytics data to be sent to our new InfluxDB host. Again, under some circumstances, [you may see a one-time message nudging you do to this](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14592).
- [Ospack's analytics documentation](https://docs.ospack.github.io/Analytics) [is updated with the new InfluxDB, post-Google Analytics reality.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14672)
- [Setting `OSPACK_NO_ENV_FILTERING` no longer fails but is silently a no-op.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/15587)
- [Ospack's deprecated Ubuntu 16.04 Docker image is no longer being built or updated.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/15050)
- [Ospack/ospack-cask-drivers is deprecated and active casks were moved to Ospack/ospack-cask.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/15535)
- [`ospack rbenv-sync`, `ospack nodenv-sync`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14972) and [`ospack pyenv-sync`](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/15507) commands will automatically sync Ospack-installed Ruby, NodeJS and Python versions with `rbenv`, `nodenv` and `pyenv` respectively to avoid needing to build these from source.
- [Ospack has laid the groundwork for later macOS Sonoma (14) support.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/15522)
- [Various](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14928) [improvements](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/15256) [sped](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/14778) up all Ruby `ospack` command performance.
- [`ospack fetch`ing bottles is significantly faster.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/15579)
- [`ospack install` with no `post_install` is significantly faster.](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/15578)
- [Various other minor release deprecations and disables](https://github.com/Ospack/ospack/pull/15632).
